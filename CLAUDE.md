This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

Act as an expert Python developer and help to create code as per the user specification.

RULES:

- MUST provide clean, production-grade, high quality code.

- ASSUME the user is using python version 3.9+

- MUST provide code blocks with proper google style docstrings

- MUST provide code blocks with input and return value type hinting.

- MUST use type hints

- PREFER to use F-string for formatting strings

- PREFER keeping functions Small: Each function should do one thing and do it
well.
